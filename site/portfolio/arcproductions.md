#### Custom Production Management System

When I arrived at Arc Productions (Starz Animation at the time), they had built their own utilitarian production
tracker. I spent four years working closely with their production teams across multiple projects, unifying the
studio's production processes and building a brand new tailor-made production management system that tracked
every aspect of production: artist assignments, shot/asset statuses, and a client-facing review tool that gave
clients the ability to annotate video frames and provide feedback. The software I built there was vital to the
success of projects such as Gnomeo and Juliet, Hoodwinked 2, Dolphin Tale and Camelot.

#### Studio Portal

The studio dashboard provided a central portal for employee's to access studio resources. It also provided
a sense of community by providing a single place to interact with others and keep up-to-date on studio news.

From the portal, employee's could access the production tracker for their projects, custom-built HR tools,
studio documentation, and much more.

#### Real-time Reporting

In addition to the tailor-made production management system, I worked closely with production to create
a variety of real-time Excel and web-based reports that gave APMs, producers and executive management
instant insight into the health of the project. Production could quickly see aggregate counts of approved
shots and assets, match work completed against bids and quota, and perform simple future projections based
on historical data.

#### HR Integration

The custom-built vacation management tool allowed artists to request vacation and have that request tracable
and visible through the approval chain. It also provided a valuable window for HR to quickly view
all of the outstanding and upcoming vacations without needing to track it manually in an Excel spreadsheet
or an Outlook calendar.
