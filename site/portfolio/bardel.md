#### Studio Portal

Bardel contacted me for a project that had a short timeframe. They were a swiftly growing studio in Vancouver,
and had several disparate systems and no central portal to access them from. They wanted to launch a new
internal intranet portal that would tie together all of these systems to coincide with the launch of their
new corporate website.

Under a tight six-week deadline, I put together an extensible intranet portal that allows other developers
to quickly and easily build and integrate new components.
