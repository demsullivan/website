#### Workflow Automation

K-Rae's custom made transportation management system allows them to accurately track and manage the movement
of heavy equipment across the US and Canada. I originally inherited K-Rae's application from another developer,
who set them up with a great foundation that automated their core business processes. My relationship with them
started out with a number of small fixes and updates, which culminated in an overhaul of the billing and driver
payment aspect of the application. I'm continuing to work with them to understand their business and find new
ways to automate and streamline their processes.
