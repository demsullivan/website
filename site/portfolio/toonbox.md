#### Production Tracking

Toonbox brought me in to lead the charge on improving their production tracking. Before my arrival, they were
mostly using spreadsheets to track production, and each department had their own way of doing things.

After some discussion about bringing in a third party solution or rolling their own proprietary systems, they
opted to bring in Shotgun. Once it was up and running, I helped to automate the tracking of assets and shots
through the pipe in Shotgun and built real-time reports that queried Shotgun to give producers up-to-the-minute
status reports.

#### HR/Accounting Automation

In addition to production tracking, I built web-based systems for vacation and timesheet tracking to replace
their hard copy counterparts. These systems ensured reporting accuracy for management and provided valuable
transparency to employees. I took this system a step further and streamlined their new hire process, providing
a central place for HR, Accounting, Systems and Production to track new hires and all the resources that
need to be set up for a new employee.

#### Production Engineering

In the Production Technology department, I helped reduce the occurrences of show-stopping toolset release
problems by switching them to a new source control system and implementing new toolset development and
release processes.
